I'm iToncek,
young developer, photographer, filmmaker and broadcaster. I enjoy doing anything that connects my hobbies if I have freedom what to do. I work at iQLandia in Liberec and sometimes broadcast to their youtube channel. You can follow me on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/itoncek.space) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/itoncek/) to see what I'm up to. Or you can also subscribe directly to [iQLandia's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@iQLANDIALiberec) to not miss any broadcasts that I (or other people here) do there.
