I'm iToncek,
young developer, photographer, filmmaker and broadcaster. I enjoy doing anything that connects my hobbies if I have freedom what to do. I work at iQLandia in Liberec and sometimes broadcast to their youtube channel. You can subscribe to my RSS channel below or directly to iQLandia's youtube channel to not miss any broadcasts. All my previous work is in tab on top of this site (if it's still missing, just wait, I'll add it soonâ„¢).
